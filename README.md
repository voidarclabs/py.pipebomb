# THIS IS A PIPEBOMB

This creates a random amount of pipebombs and delivers them to your mailbox.
All the pipebombs have a convenient label: `this is a pipebomb`

This is less of a zip bomb and more of a proof of concept; It completes almost instantly 
with less than 300 files. Do not use this maliciously or without explicit permission.
That means no crashes. That's right. Looking at you over there. 

If you fill up your PC with too many files, I am not liable as the code has been modified.
The placeholder will be removed after first run.
